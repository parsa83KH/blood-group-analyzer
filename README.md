## 🔬 What is this project?

**Blood Group Analyzer** is a state-of-the-art web application designed for clinical lab science, genetics education, and transfusion safety simulation.  
It integrates modern frontend technology (React, TypeScript, Vite) and an AI conversational assistant (Gemini LLM) to help users:

- Model and visualize all possible ABO & Rh blood group outcomes for any family constellation.
- Analyze genotype/phenotype probabilities for children, given parental blood groups.
- Determine transfusion compatibility for every family member—including edge biological cases (weak D, subgroups).
- Ask complex laboratory, clinical, or genetics questions and get immediate, context-aware answers via built-in AI.

## 🚩 Core Features

- **Family Inheritance Simulator:**  
  Enter the ABO/Rh of parents and instantly see all *genetically consistent* child options and their probabilities.

- **Transfusion Compatibility Matrix:**  
  Automatic advising on which family members can donate to, or receive from, others—according to current transfusion guidelines.

- **Probability Visualization:**  
  Interactively displays exact genotype & phenotype probabilities for each scenario.

- **Expert Mode:**  
  Advanced user support for rare blood groups, weak D, ambiguous or rare genotypes (e.g., Bombay, cis-AB), and unique clinical scenarios.

- **Conversational AI Assistant:**  
  Ask anything—explanations of inheritance rules, "What if" clinical cases, or deep science queries. Powered by the Gemini API.

- **Modern, Mobile-Friendly UI:**  
  Designed for lab, classroom, or bedside use—optimized for both desktop and mobile browsers.

## 🧑‍⚕️ Who is it for?

- **Medical Laboratory Science students and educators**
- **Clinical pathologists and transfusion medicine practitioners**
- **Genetics instructors & researchers**
- **Medical/paramedical students**
- Anyone curious about the fascinating world of blood group inheritance and its real-life impact

---

## 🎓 Scientific Foundations

This app relies on:

- **Mendelian genetics**: Full modeling of classic ABO codominance, O-recessive, and RhD dominant/recessive inheritance.
- **Transfusion policy**: Strict algorithmic validation of donor–recipient compatibilities, including edge/rare groups.
- **Lab accuracy**: All calculations/cases verified against academic references and actual clinical laboratory data.

> _Designed as an educational and decision-support tool. Clinical responsibilities remain with qualified health professionals._

## 💬 Why use the AI Assistant?

- Discuss clinical puzzles (“Can an AB– father have an O+ child?”)
- Review theoretical scenarios (“Probability of two B+ parents having an AB– child?”)
- Get immediate explanations of confusing inheritance rules—no textbook needed!
